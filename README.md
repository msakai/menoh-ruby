[![Build status (AppVeyor)](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/reowah7bx31vep7o?svg=true)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/pfnet-research/menoh-ruby)

This is a Ruby extension of [Menoh](https://github.com/pfnet-research/menoh); an ONNX runtime engine developed by [@okdshin](https://github.com/okdshin) and their team [@pfnet-research](https://github.com/pfnet-research).

## Installation

You need `ruby-dev`, `bundler`, `rake-compiler` to install this extension.

```bash
$ sudo apt install ruby-dev
$ sudo gem install bundler
$ sudo gem install rake-compiler
```

And add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'menoh'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install menoh

## Usage

Please see [Menoh tutorial](https://github.com/pfnet-research/menoh/blob/master/docs/tutorial.md) and [menoh-ruby tutorial](https://github.com/pfnet-research/menoh-ruby/blob/master/docs/tutorial.md).
And we have [some examples](https://github.com/pfnet-research/menoh-ruby/blob/master/example/) on this repository.

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install ruby dependencies. Then, run `rake test` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
